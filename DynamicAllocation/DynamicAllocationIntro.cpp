/*Dyamic allocation allows for programs to request memory from the OS when needed.
This memory does not come from the stack, but instead from the heap, which is a larger pool of memory.
This can be gigabytes in size (for modern systems)*/

    /*The delete operator does not actually delete anything.
    It simply returns the memory being pointed to back to the operating system.
    The operating system is then free to reassign that memory to another application (or to this application again later).
    Although it looks like weâ€™re deleting a variable, this is not the case!
    The pointer variable still has the same scope as before, and can be assigned a new value just like any other variable.*/
